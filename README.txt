Android WebView wrapper project for the provided HTML file.

What's included:
- Android Studio project (Kotlin) that loads assets/index.html in a WebView.
- Your original HTML has been placed in app/src/main/assets/index.html. (Source: uploaded file). 

Important notes:
- This environment cannot compile an APK. You need Android Studio or command-line SDK to build the APK.
- To build:
  1. Open this folder (the one containing settings.gradle.kts) in Android Studio.
  2. Let Android Studio sync/gradle download dependencies.
  3. Connect an Android device or use an emulator, then Build > Run to install a debug APK.
  4. To produce a release APK: Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK... and follow signing steps.

If you want, I can additionally provide step-by-step commands to build with command-line (gradlew) and a suggested keystore config.
